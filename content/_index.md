Currently working as a **Technical Developer at Telefónica Germany**, I design and build robust, scalable systems — from Salesforce Lightning components to API-driven B2B order processing. I’ve led development initiatives that improve operational efficiency and user experience across internal platforms.

I thrive in fast-paced environments that require ownership, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous learning.
